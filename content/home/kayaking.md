Kayaking is one of my favorite passions in life, whether it be leading a guided trip, exploring the Oregon coastline, or challenging myself on whitewater rivers with friends. I particularly enjoy sea kayak surfing and rock gardening on the coast as well as boofing holes on the rivers of the Pacific Northwest. 

I have numerous certifications from the British Canoeing and the American Canoe Association which make me a very qualified coach and leader. The important certifications include: BCU coach level 1, BCU 3* sea award, ACA level 3 whitewater instructor, a swift water rescue certification from Rescue 3 International, and a Wildernes First Responder from WMI. 

Please email me for further information about my paddling experience. Also download my fairly current kayaking trip log <a href="file/log.pdf" target="\_blank">here</a> and/or my resume <a href="file/kayaking.pdf" target="\_blank">here</a>
